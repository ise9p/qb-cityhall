# City Hall System

## Overview
This system allows players to interact with a City Hall in a FiveM server, offering functionalities like job selection, obtaining identity documents (e.g., ID card, driver license), and managing various administrative tasks.

## Features
- NPC Interaction: The system allows players to interact with NPCs placed at the City Hall location.
- Job Menu: Players can select from various available jobs.
- Identity Documents: Players can obtain identity documents such as an ID card and driver license for a fee.
- City Hall Blip: A City Hall marker is placed on the map for easy access.
